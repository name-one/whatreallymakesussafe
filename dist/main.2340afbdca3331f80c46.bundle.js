This way of thinking, sometimes called the "<strong>perpetrator perspective</strong>," makes people think about racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and ableism in terms of <strong>individual behaviors and bad intentions rather than wide-scale structural oppression</strong> that often operates without some obvious individual actor aimed at denying an individual person an opportunity. The violence of imprisoning millions of poor people and people of color, for example, can’t be adequately explained by finding one nasty racist individual, but instead requires looking at a whole web of institutions, policies, and practices that make it <strong>"normal" and "necessary"</strong> to warehouse, displace, discard, and annihilate poor people and people of color.

This group distanced itself from the former activist-oriented agenda aimed at social change and developed a more professional identity as ‘specialists’ who worked with women who experienced male violence.

Scaffolded by hyperbolic media coverage of child abductions and sexual assaults by strangers, restrictions for convicted child sex offenders continue to escalate. Civil commitment laws, enacted in over a dozen states by 2008 and upheld by the Supreme Court in a 2005 decision, aim to geographically detain and segregate certain categories of sex offenders, indefinitely, after release (Feuer 2005; Davey and Goodnough 2007).

Criminalizing men who assault their intimate partners, for example, has led to a rise in the incarceration (and deportation) of poor men of color, not a decline in the number of women who are assaulted (Wittner 1998; Sen 1999; Richie 2000). In addition, despite the <strong>criminalization of queers, a population historically defined as sex offenders</strong>, national lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) organizations have not documented how current SORs potentially impact those who identify as LGBT or non-heteronormative.

By identifying the experiences in Joshua’s life in which <strong>he learned these negative identity conclusions</strong> about himself, he has been able to recognize that <strong>his identity is not innate, natural, and static but, rather, fluid and changeable</strong>. As a result, Joshua has been able to challenge these identity conclusions and move closer to his preferences for fairness and justice.<br><br>Talking about <strong>Joshua’s past experiences of victimization and injustice does not create excuses, justify, or mitigate Joshua’s responsibility</strong> for choosing to sexually abuse his daughter. Joshua’s own childhood abuse did not cause him to sexually abuse others. Most people who are sexually abused do not abuse others. The meaning Joshua made of his having been abused, however, informed his choices to sexually abuse. Through being sexually abused, Joshua was recruited into believing that he was "dirty," "bad," and "disgusting," and, therefore, he acted accordingly.

We ask people to consider <strong>what they need for their safety and healing</strong>, and what it would take for lasting transformation to take place. We ask them <strong>what might get in the way of accountability</strong> – what experiences or memories they might need to revisit, what beliefs or messaging they might need to unlearn. But it is to acknowledge that accountability means different things to different people, and those specificities should shape the process and its goals.<br><br>For example: I have heard <strong>survivors of violence</strong> express that accountability would mean having their experiences validated; feeling a shift in their community spaces; having a coherent narrative of what happened to them. <strong>Sometimes, it is important for these things to work in relation to the person who did the violence; other times, it’s not. Sometimes it is, but that isn’t possible</strong> – or at least not in the way they envision, right now. But sometimes there are other ways to get a piece of what they need. Having supported or facilitated conversations with loved ones might feel validating. Having a meeting at their work, school, or organizing space might start to shift dynamics that allowed violence to take place. Exchanging letters or other mediated communication with the person who did violence might allow a survivor to articulate their experience in a helpful way. These are actions all of us are capable of supporting right now. I have heard <strong>people who bore witness to violence</strong> describe accountability as expressing support for survivors; holding clear and consistent boundaries amongst themselves; learning the skills they need to better intervene. An organization might show their support for survivors through a collective statement, or simply through daily actions of interdependent care. A family might learn to express and respect boundaries by practicing open communication and consent. A group of friends might prepare themselves to prevent and stop violence by taking a course in mediation, de-escalation, or medical care. These, too, are things that many of us can do.<br><br><strong>This doesn’t mean that everyone is always satisfied</strong> – sometimes folks don’t get what they want – or what they want changes – and it can be painful and unfair.

Compelled to respond to conservative state tendencies regarding families, gender, and sexuality, <strong>they pursued a safer, less antagonistic strategy</strong> that they expected would be more acceptable to the new conservative national, legislative, and local leadership. This group distanced itself from the former activist-oriented agenda aimed at social change and developed a more professional identity as ‘specialists’ who worked with women who experienced male violence.

So if they\'re already not getting justice from the legal system, it\'s also this moment of survivors being like, <strong>"Well, what else is out there?" and finding transformative justice work or community accountability work</strong>.<br><br>-Kiyomi Fujikawa'},{id:85,title:"Lawyer to organizer",quote:"My background is that I started out as a <strong>legal services lawyer</strong>, so for people who don't have money, doing free legal aid. And most of that work was around domestic violence. I did that for four years and really quickly became really discouraged and frustrated, by the systems and the lack of transformative approach and the lack of even trying to challenge the systems that we were all navigating. It was just all very problematic.<br><br>And so I became a <strong>community organizer</strong> with the idea of starting a project that would respond to issues of violence against women and girls from an organizing perspective, aimed at systems change rather than providing services alone. So I did organizing for a bunch of years on a pretty wide range of issues and <strong>started Women and Girls Collective Action Network</strong>, which set out to do that work.</br>I had been doing community organizing, and <strong>when you go door-knocking</strong> and you <strong>ask people what their issues are, not surprisingly they never say violence against women and girls and young people</strong>. That's just not what they say. They say we need more trash cans or tree-trimming or \"get those gang bangers off the street\" or whatever. These issues aren't coming up, so I had questions like – <strong>what would it take for those issues to surface?</strong>What could organizing groups do differently to start to responding to issues that really matter for women and girls, and what could the women's movement do differently?<br><br>And then Women and Girls CAN became broader than just community organizing and really delved into <strong>community accountability and transformative justice</strong> and a combination of doing grassroots community organizing work and bringing people together to think through different approaches of trying to end violence against women and girls rather than reacting to it. A lot of it was <strong>looking back at old pieces from the 70s, before things in the U.S. got so state-owned</strong>. Before violence against women got silo'ed into the anti-rape work and the domestic violence work, and all of it funded by the state. You know, there were other ideas of how to approach all of this, and they just kind of got cast aside. So we went back to some of that, but also tried to <strong>tie it into a much more current understanding of racial justice and oppressions</strong>.<br><br>-Melissa Spatz"},{id:86,title:"Safe Outside the System training",quote:'So I still live in the same neighborhood I lived in when I was at the Audre Lorde Project [ALP]. It took us a really long time to develop the campaign, because I didn\'t know anything about community accountability when I worked there. <strong>I had been organizing low-wage workers, mostly women of color</strong>, and I\'d done that for about five years before ALP. So I had a lot of structural [skills] – this is how you build the base, this is how you build the campaign, this is what it looks like. They [Audre Lorde Project] were like "Yeah, but without the police." I was like, "But the police would be the natural target [for our organizing against state violence]." It\'s not that I was down with the police, but I was like, "Oh god, how does this happen!?"<br><br>So it took us a year and a half, and <strong>we started to organize local businesses and institutions</strong>, and recruit them. We started to organize local businesses and institutions, and recruit them. We didn\'t have a curriculum, we had to create a <strong>"How to Be Safe Outside the System" training</strong>.<br><br>A lot of times these spaces were people who were not anti-LGBT folks, but just not really understanding [LGBT issues]. So the training included some <strong>basics on heterosexism, homophobia</strong>, transphobia, some info on the violence that had been happening in the neighborhood, some info that they were already deeply acquainted with about how police violence is flowing in the neighborhood.<br><br>Then we would just do this facilitated discussion. So, if a fight broke out in your space, <strong>what would you do?</strong> If this happened, what would you do? <strong>Many of the businesses would assume they didn’t have safety strategies, they did but weren’t explicit to them</strong>. They were not written down, they were just in their head as ‘this is what we did.’ So we wanted to do that to make it more explicit to them. <strong>We wanted to make sure those strategies included queer and trans folks of color</strong>. We wanted to have them have a sense of when and how violence can erupt, for instance, that you actually have to stop somebody with homophobic or transphobic language, because that will escalate.<br><br>'+"Then we'd make a little plan with them about what they would do. But we felt really clear that we didn't feel we could build base if we forced them to sign on to the 'We will never call the police.' <strong>It didn't feel fair to ask to do that when we didn't have another thing for them to call</strong>.<br><br>They already were in many ways [practicing community-based strategies]. It was <strong>community-based strategies but it wasn't necessarily transformative</strong>. There was this one space that was like, \"Well if things get really bad I call the guy who owns the corner store across the street cuz he owns a machete\" (laughs). That’s a response but it’s not transformative. It is totally about threatening.<br><br><strong>That’s one of those questions as a movement we have to [ask ourselves]</strong>.

Or, 'My dad abused me, but it's complicated, like I still care about him.' And the way that I was trained to respond to those feelings was 'You're delusional', 'He hurt you, he's in the wrong, the appropriate feeling for you to have is anger and to want revenge and retribution and whatever.' I think in later years of working there, I remember hearing that so much and just being so trained to shut it down, that that's something that sticks with me around <strong>people's visions of justice</strong>, that they <strong>are actually so different from the kinds of justice that we're trained to shovel them into</strong>.<br><br>-Alix Johnson"},{id:88,title:"Mediation ignores power relations",quote:'Mediation between the survivor or victim and person doing harm is not recommended.

As Deer (2009:156) argues, in many Native American communities, these <strong>models are often pushed on domestic violence survivors to pressure them</strong> to reconcile with their families and "restore" the community without sufficient concern for their personal safety. In addition, Native American domestic violence advocates have been critical that some restorative justice processes <strong>co-opt "traditional" forms of governance</strong> to address domestic violence. They argue that Native communities have been pressured to adopt "circle sentencing" because it is a traditional indigenous practice.

Restorative Justice models aim to <strong>restore intimate relationships and community bonds</strong> that have been damaged by interpersonal violence, through practices of <strong>community dialog and appeals to collective values</strong>. Restorative justice approaches seek to increase the involvement of community stakeholders, more fully address survivor’s rights in the judicial process, and identify means to repair harm and restore balance in the community. Many of the most powerful Restorative Justice approaches in the U.S. and Canada have long been practiced within <strong>indigenous communities</strong> that seek justice and conflict resolution using shared values and systems of accountability distinct from State systems.<br><br>Outside of these communities, the Restorative Justice approach has largely been <strong>co-opted by the State</strong> for use in coercive contexts in which the integrity of such a model is put into question. Some faith-based Restorative Justice projects have partnered with the State and become service providers in tandem with State-based systems of accountability. Other Restorative Justice models are offered as post-incarceration rehabilitation programs intended to "restore" the community standing of the person or people that are abusive. To a greater or lesser extent, these models do <strong>expand the possibilities of accountability and transformation</strong> through engaging and educating members of the intimate and/or community networks in which the abuse occurs. But such models have been <strong>appropriated by the criminal legal system</strong> as a way to involve the community in punishing the person that has been violent and then ‘restoring’ the conditions that already existed when the abuse originally took place.<br><br>-generationFIVE: J.

There had to be some common ground for mediation, but both were too emotionally invested to find it themselves, so they asked for mediation.  I currently offer a <strong>mediation support service</strong> in a social centre in London, but I find that people would rather turn to friends that they can trust, rather than someone they have never met before! Which is totally understandable. Especially if they are specifically seeking support that is non- institutional or non-professional.<br><br>But the <strong>next step is figuring out what the survivor wants to happen, what the perpetrator would like to change or act on in light of the circumstances... and every situation is different. A common resolution is that there is social separation of the two parties, where they arrange to not be at the same events at the same time. Or maybe the perpetrator will be excluded from activities for a period of time. Usually the community supports this by organising around that, (eg. if both are facilitating at a workshop event, etc), but sometimes it's a difficult matter of confidentiality, where a community may be neeed to support the outcomes of a survivor's requests, but it is part of the request that people don't speak of the event, or of the specific details of the incident.<br><br>Then, thirdly, there are the <strong>processes of realising those defined terms</strong>. As usual, <strong>things in practice don't pan out as well as they do in theory</strong>, and conflict usually arises out of that, especially when people are missing out on things, eg. events, that they resent missing out on, or resent sacrifices in general that they hadn't thought of in beginning the mediation process. So <strong>continual mediation</strong> is necessary to iron out those things. Some things don't get resolved, and some requests get ignored, so there are a lot of tense and angry emotions surrounding this process.

We ask people to consider <strong>what they need for their safety and healing</strong>, and what it would take for lasting transformation to take place.

These are actions all of us are capable of supporting right now. I have heard <strong>people who bore witness to violence</strong> describe accountability as expressing support for survivors; holding clear and consistent boundaries amongst themselves; learning the skills they need to better intervene. An organization might show their support for survivors through a collective statement, or simply through daily actions of interdependent care. A family might learn to express and respect boundaries by practicing open communication and consent.

Sometimes people didn't want to join or get involved with ALP, but would be like \"Oh, I'll totally give $10 that you will pass on to a parent who loses a child.\" And then they'd be like, \"Okay, fine, you can have my email address\" (laughs).<br><br>So what I think of as a dirty secret of the transformative justice or the community accountability movement... My constant question is: <strong>do the people who are most affected by these things really want the thing we are building? And can they access it?</strong> I think that the answer is yes, but we have to find a different way... Yes, but there's a gap. Yes, and I don't know what the gap is. Yes, because most of the people I know who have lost their kids also have experiences with criminalization and imprisonment, they have all these other really fucked-up systemic experiences.  But <strong>[the system] is also the only thing they have</strong>. They're like, \"Unleash this motherfucker on this person who hurt me or hurt my family.\" So it's a challenge.<br><br>I think the more that we can say [this secret] and be open with it, the less that we are actually dogmatically bringing or holding onto our politics. Like these phrases we are supposed to say, it starts to feel a little religious. So yeah, I don't know, does everyone transform? Or, I don't know, does everyone want [community accountability]? I really don't know.<br><br><strong>I want to work on something and keep working on it and one day I want it to be so useful and so impactful and so effective, that even in peoples' deepest moments of trauma, they could find solace in this</strong>. Let it push us to up our rigor and push us to up our thoughtfulness.  We have to think about the idea of GenerationFIVE [to end child sexual abuse in the next five generations]. Maybe we are working on stuff that's going to be helpful far in advance.

Indeed, this exercise proved to be an important step in goal setting.

I mean there was an agenda of challenging the women's movement and building a different thing. But our agenda didn't include doing media justice work or healing organizing or community accountability even. It started with: <strong>\"What would it look like if a different group of people other than the people who have traditionally run the women's movement got to define what the issue was, how they would want to respond to it, and got to take action and be the leaders?\"<strong> Instead of having the ED of the local organization be the leader. We weren't even sure it would be around violence against women at first. It was like, what if a group of younger women got to just define the issues for themselves. Maybe we do reproductive justice work, maybe it's economic justice work, maybe it's something none of us have thought about. It was supposed to be a one year exploratory project.<br><br>What happened was when I met with adult women about it, like professors and members of different organizations, they were like \"This is a good one year exploratory project. I would like to put out a report.\" And when I started meeting with <strong>youth<strong>, they were like \"<strong>Let's just take action together. Why are we studying?\"<strong><br><br>It became a 501c3, so we were also part of the non-profit industrial complex. It had several different elements. There was a youth organizing piece called <strong>Females United for Action [FUFA]<strong>, organizing mostly high school students, some college students. FUFA in its early days took the stance that the <strong>reason there's so much violence against young women of color was media images of young women of color<strong>. So they did <strong>media justice work<strong>, which was really cool and powerful to watch. Then they became more interested in <strong>healing organizing<strong> and developing concepts around healing. And FUFA started out as a coalition of organizations, and then added individuals, and kind of changed back and forth: there were organizational members of youth groups and also individual young people.<br><br>FUFA also went through a lot of work around <strong>trans issues<strong>. FUFA at one point got approached by trans young women asking if they could join and then did a series of sessions on learning about trans oppression and shifted its focus. And actually in the last days of Women and Girls CAN, there were some discussions before I left about whether to change the name Women and Girls CAN because some people felt it didn't express being open to trans women and girls.<br><br>The <strong>community accountability group<strong> was a group, 7 or 8 women from all different perspectives, all interested in doing this work, some academic, some organizers, some from a social service perspective, all interested in trying to figure this piece out. So it was something more like a think tank than doing actual actions. We met regularly; it was half white women and half women of color. Very focused on <strong>racial justice<strong>. So if women of color couldn't make the meetings, we would cancel them. Trying to reflect on how much the women's movement in this country has been dominated by white women and really just shut out the voices of anyone who wasn't a middle- or upper-class heterosexual white woman. So we were trying to be really conscious of that. And that group put on a bunch of different workshops for the community and put out this writing piece [\"Communities Engaged in Resisting Violence\"], that came out of all of that. It was trying to document what was happening in Chicago and promote conversations and see if we could move things further.

Do I need to be close friends with people in order for it to make sense, or does that actually not make sense? Because I walked into this process and I wasn\'t close friends with anyone involved.

No, not leniency, I don\'t know about leniency, but maybe I was easier to deal with because I wasn\'t so emotionally close to the process, and there are pro\'s and con\'s about that. I was able to walk in and play the <strong>compassionate role<strong>, and it worked because other people were playing the more <strong>critical role<strong>, "Are you actually doing what you say you\'re doing?

This fear that they would end up being either not welcome in certain spaces in the city or they would lose friends over it and just really not wanting that to happen. So being pretty motivated to do this process and stick with it even when it was super hard.We can really credit some of their friends with ... encouraging them to feel that way is a bad way to put it, cuz it was almost... <strong>it almost felt punitive at times<strong>. I was like "Oh my god, you\'re actually scared of what could happen if this process ended, cuz you have a couple friends who are explicitly not gonna be around if this ends."<br><br>But I mean for me that ended up getting me to reflect on the kind of <strong>power that facilitators of those processes wield<strong>.

And we were like, "No, clearly not." And they were like, "Well, think it through, maybe you could have done it differently. Or maybe you could have done it in this way, or whatever."<br><br>If there are a lot of people in your community who are like "We are going to continue to relate to this person, even though they\'ve been called out, on the basis that their accountability process is going well and they seem to be dealing with it in good faith."
