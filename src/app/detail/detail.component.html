        This research project began as an informal exchange between organizers working on community accountability & transformative justice (here abbreviated as CA-TJ) responses to sexual violence. Our fledgling <a href="https://www.transformativejustice.eu/en/">transformative justice collective in Berlin, Germany</a> was geographically far from the mothership of CA-TJ thought and organizing in the U.S. Dialoguing with those who had created and propelled this work became a mode of both giving and taking account of one another.

          That informal exchange expanded into a participatory research project in 2013 as the foundations of my Master’s thesis. The research explored the theoretical underpinnings of CA-TJ, like what does it mean to be <span style="font-style: italic;">accountable</span> after all? And who or what is <span style="font-style: italic;">a community?</span>
          <a href="http://www.incite-national.org/page/participatory-action-research">Participatory action research</a> is an approach that understands all participants in a research process to be co-creators of the project’s goals, methods, and outcomes. In my interviews, our dialogues offered an opportunity to collectively think through questions emerging out of our respective practices. Interview partners shared organizational materials, connected me with other activists, and even read parts of my thesis.
          However, this project was not fully participatory from start to finish. Participants were scattered across the U.S. and Canada, so we could not meet at one table and political work put limits on time. The research took the shape of a net weaving from one node of organizing to another, as a set of questions and ideas developed in one conversation was carried into the next. This site allows me to put all those conversations side by side.

        Carceral Approach: Individual Response
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Sexual violence is often pathologized in mainstream society as an individual problem caused by a few <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 1)">‘ bad apples’</span>. The larger structures of oppression that teach <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 2)">violence as an instrument for asserting power</span> fade into the background, and violence is blamed on moral weakness or mental ‘ illness.’
        <br>
        <br>
        In the U.S., the State offers us a limited set of responses to sexual violence: the criminal legal system for perpetrators, and professional anti-violence services for survivors. Both of these are largely individualized responses to what is seen as an individual problem. Options like <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 3)">therapy and women’ s shelters for survivors and restraining orders and pressing charges against perpetrators</span> often exclude political solutions that could organize collective change and <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 4)">confront the roots of sexual and gender-based violence</span>. This failure to get at the root problem can also explain why these approaches naively rely on the State, rather than recognizing the ways the State participates in and enables violence in the first place.

      <div class="question">
        Transformative approaches see individual acts of violence <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 5)">as rooted in and reflections of structures of oppression</span> we all participate in: <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 8)">“it’ s all of us, and some of us [...] act it out”</span>.

        <br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, violence has a <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 9)">ripple effect through a community</span>, impacting everyone in different ways.

      <div class="question">
        When sexual violence is seen as the immoral actions of a few evil monsters, the common response is to cast those who cause harm out of society. But this view leaves us in a bind when violence happens among our friends and family, as we are left with the choice to either <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 13)">demonize or minimize</span> what perpetrators do.
        <br>
        <br>
        Many people minimize or even deny sexual violence because it can be <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 14)">too painful to recognize acts of harm committed by those we love</span> and consider ‘ good people.’
        <br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, demonizing people who cause harm often plays out along histories of oppression. People of color, and African-Americans in particular, have long been represented by dominant society as <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 15)">monsters or criminals</span>, queer and trans people <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 16)">as sexual predators</span>, and people with disabilities and neurological diversity as less than human.

        Not only are perpetrators portrayed in oversimplified, moralistic ways, <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 17)">survivors are often seen</span> as innocent or helpless. But ‘ innocence’  appears to be a commodity not available to every survivor, as many marginalized women who are victims of violence, like sex workers or trans women, do not find protection but rather are themselves <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 18)">criminalized</span> and <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 19)">punished by the State</span>.

        In the face of these moral economies of good & bad guy, victim & perpetrator, a transformative approach offers a different principle that unites us and makes us human: <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 20)">everyone both experiences and causes harm</span> (both interpersonal violence and structural oppression) to varying degrees in their lives. While structural positioning impacts how vulnerability to harm or be harmed is distributed, this still gives us a humble starting point for what we share.

        <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 21)">The prison abolition</span> and Black Lives Matter movements have encouraged us to hold the <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 22)">complexity</span> & <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 23)">humanity</span> of people who cause harm and <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 24)">see ourselves in them</span>.

As many interviewees emphasized, holding complexity <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 28)">doesn’ t reduce the responsibility</span> of persons who cause harm; it offers explanations, not excuses.
        <br>
        <br>
        Allowing for complexity has led community accountability scholar-activists to wrestle with the <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 29)">victim-perpetrator binary</span>, seeing the division as <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 30)">useful in some settings and dangerous in others</span>.

        <br>
        Talking about the <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 37)">“full, messy, broken, heroic, petty realness”</span> of survival disrupts the idealized picture of survivors as innocent and helpless by emphasizing that <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 34)">survivors do make choices</span>, even in cases of extreme oppression and violence. Support means cultivating the <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 35)">agency, self-determination, and self-accountability</span> of survivors, without <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 36)">blaming them</span> for what they experienced.

        Carceral Approach: Blame & Punishment
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Because sexual violence is seen as an individual, moral issue, responsibility is framed as guilt or blame. The model of responsibility on which the prison industrial complex and other carceral institutions of society are built is what philosopher Iris Marion Young calls a “liability model” of responsibility, in which I am responsible for actions that I voluntarily, knowingly, and intentionally cause. This model is built on the ‘ sovereign’ subject of liberalist theory. It assumes an atomistic, autonomous individual who has free choice and whose intentions, actions, and their consequences are fully transparent to him (I say ‘ him’  because this free subject has traditionally been male). This concept of the human focuses more on the self and ignores the interpersonal relationships and social structures that co-create the self.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this model, responsibility is like debt: I create a debt by violating the rights of others, which must be repaid by denying my rights in proportion to my wrongdoing. These are my ‘ just deserts,’  fulfilled through retributive punishment (‘ an eye for an eye’ ). ‘ Taking account’  works like a math equation that determines who owns which misdeeds. Human life is framed in terms of <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 37)">accounting and property, reminiscent of slavery</span>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, my wrongdoings are seen as the result of my moral failures. My actions say something about my deepest character and ability to govern myself. This “real self” view of our actions is often popularly understood in our climate of retributive sentiment as moral essentialism. From an essentialist perspective, committing sexual violence signals something morally wrong and thus <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 381)">difficult or impossible to change about a person</span>. This feeds attitudes that certain people (or groups of people) are inherently criminal and cultivates punitive feelings of guilt and shame in people who cause harm. Those feelings often keep people who cause harm focused on themselves (their intentions, deepest character, or moral status) and prevents them from seeing and responding to those who they have harmed.

    <div class="question-content accardion" id="Accountability">
      <div class="title title-font unitalic">
        Transformative Approach: Accountability
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        In contrast, a community accountability model starts with a radically different concept of the subject: socially constructed both within relationships of intimacy and recognition and through relationships of power and oppression. Drawing on indigenous, disability, feminist, and postcolonial theories, it sees individuals as shaped by different levels of intersubjectivity, ranging from family to community to social structures.
        <br>
        <br>
        Violence does not originate in any one of those levels of inter subjectivity but is an interaction between all of them, as <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 39)">violence at interpersonal levels is enabled and reinforced by violence at structural and State levels</span>.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this model, responsibility for causing harm is less a <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 37)">mathematical calculation of ‘ taking account’</span>, than it is a mode of response to my relations with others, relations which constitute me and which I cannot fully master. Harm is understood not primarily as a violation of rights, but of particular human relationships. This calls for a <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 382)">cycle of prevention, reparation, and transformation</span> in order to address <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 39)">those relationships</span> and <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 40)">behaviors</span>.  Rather than the application of universal laws to a particular case, accountability is <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 41)">tailored to the specifics</span> of the situation and particular needs. As Alix Johnson explains, it is <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 42)">“contextual rather than prescriptive”</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        In this form of response, I give <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 43)">an account of myself</span> and my actions, a narrative, an explanation. My account of myself is also always an account of all the larger forces that shaped me, but being a social creature <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 44)">doesn’ t limit my agency or take away my ability to be responsible</span>. Rather, being a social creature is the basis of my agency and the grounds of my response. In fact, responsibility as responding is only possible because I am connected to and shaped by others around me.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whereas the moral essentialist view would tell me my violent behavior says that my character is inherently bad, in a transformative approach, becoming aware of my socialization allows me to <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 45)">make choices</span> that build my agency and self-determination: to <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 46)">re-shape myself</span> and <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 47)">re-author my story</span>. It also allows me to focus less on intent and more on effect and turn towards those I have harmed to cultivate empathy and response to them.

        Carceral Approach: Security

      <div class="question">
        The previous section explains why a carceral logic of blame and punishment can’ t end violence because it neither encourages individuals causing harm to change their behavior nor does it address the underlying conditions that promote violence. But that carceral logic doesn’ t even benefit those it claims to protect: survivors.
        <br>
        <br>
        When violence is individualized in a moral economy of ‘ good victims’  and ‘ bad perpetrators,’ ‘ victims’  are often portrayed as weak, helpless, and vulnerable. They need rescuing by powerful outsiders, be it service professionals or cops.  Starting in the 1980s, as the anti-violence movement became more mainstream and institutionalized, it often <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 48)">turned to the State</span> for protection.
        <br>
        <br>
        But a relationship of protection can nevertheless be one of <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 49)">domination, even if cloaked in the language of security</span>. The security State has two faces which correspond to two faces of masculine power. One is associated with male violence and dominance turned outwards towards what are seen as ‘ enemies’ , in the form of prisons and policing. The other is a face of ‘ good men’  who protect the sanctity of white, heteronormative, middle and upper class women and the feminized private sphere, a‘ hearth’  they can come home to.
        <br>
        <br>
        This security model has racist and colonial qualities as well. When security and protection has been offered to women of color by State agents, it has often been done as if those women need ‘ saving’  from their own communities, pathologizing communities of color and heroizing white saviors who parachute in. In tune with increased privatization of
        social welfare functions of the State, security is seen as a <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 50)">commodity or service</span> that only a ‘ powerful outsider’  can provide, for a price.

        But what if survivors, and their surrounding communities, are seen as <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 51)">powerful and full of resources</span>, rather than as ‘ victims’ ? Rather than outsourcing protection, <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 52)">safety is “self-generated”</span> by recognizing and building survivors’  and their allies’  own capacities to withstand and resist violence and oppression. When safety is understood not as avoidance but engagement with causes of harm, survivors can become advocates and activists, not only for themselves but also for wider social change.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, such empowerment calls upon us to <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 53)">lose our attachment to a ‘ victim’  label</span>, and the forms of both security and dependency it may have made possible for us, in favor of a view of ourselves with agency.
        <br>
        <br>
        But social change requires risk, a word not often paired with the idea of safety and certainly the inverse of protection.  However, <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 54)">generationFIVE points out that social change necessarily requires risks</span>.  With enough support, a survivor may decide to take a short-term individual risk by making their case public, because they see it as a valuable efforts towards the long-term safety not only for themselves but for other future partners of their abuser.  Or a survivor may decide to take on an active role in a process and advocate for herself, accepting the risks of exposure, backlash, or gossip, but also offering her the chance to have her truth heard.  Of course, such risks must be chosen by those potentially most affected and made with careful planning to limit negative consequences.

      <div class="question">
        The strong moral division between perpetrators and survivors is often manifested physically and geographically in State responses to violence, where the solution to violence is isolating perpetrators and survivors from one another, as well as from their communities, in carceral spaces like the prison, the psychiatric hospital, or even <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 55)">the women’ s</span> <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 56)">shelter</span>. Protection is understood as <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 57)">the severing of connection</span> or <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 58)">even the denial of human vulnerability</span>, a project as impossible as it is dangerous. Tragically, isolation tends to reinforce cycles of violence and leaves no one safer.
        <br>
        <br>
        Rather than recognize the structural, collective sources that make us feel insecure (like precarious jobs, everyday oppression, or lack of participation in the decision that affect our lives), a sense of danger is projected onto specific scapegoats labeledcriminals and terrorists, which the military or police to try to remove or eliminate from society. Aggression is cast as self-defense (the inverse of how <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 60)">marginalized women’ s self-defense against violence is often reframed as aggression</span>).

        Some survivors are looking for ways to address violence <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 61)">without they or their abuser having to leave the community</span>. So how can communities <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 62)">embrace vulnerability</span> rather than denying it or turning it into a weapon used to criminalize and punish others?
        <br>
        <br>
        A transformative approach could envision safety more as a toolbox than as a protected space, a process rather than a product. Rather than focusing on safety as an end-state where harm is completely eliminated through a logic of moral purity and containment of ‘ contamination,’  a transformative approach focuses on safety as an ongoing process of collective change. That process is only as strong as <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 63)">our relationships</span> are.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, can friends and family organize enough support for a survivor that she feels safe staying in community and in connection with them, rather than moving to a women’ s shelter?  Is it possible to ask the community, the organization, or even the person causing harm to change?  How can we support that work so that survivors aren’ t being pushed out of their communities?

        What are Community Accountability & Transformative Justice?
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        In general, ‘community accountability’  and ‘transformative justice’  describe community-based, self-organized responses to violence, particularly sexual violence and intimate partner violence, that support survivor and community safety, prevent future violence, and hold perpetrators and communities accountable for their behaviors and the conditions which allowed violence to occur.
        Community accountability was first coined and developed by <a href="http://www.incite-national.org/page/community-accountability">INCITE!</a>, national network of feminist of color, and particularly by their member group CARA (Communities Against Rape and Abuse) from Seattle:

        <br>
        <br>
        The term “transformative justice” has been developed in particular by <a href="http://www.generationfive.org/the-issue/transformative-justice/">GenerationFIVE</a> in their work to end child sexual abuse in 5 generations:
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        These terms describe visionary, new approaches to harm which are applied to many different kinds of work. My interviewees described work that ranged from reading groups to years-long accountability processes with perpetrators, from neighborhood organizing with local businesses for queer and trans safety to mediation processes between persons causing and persons experiencing harm. They told stories about what brought them into this work and the learning processes they've been through in their organizations or communities, including challenges they've faced and questions they are still marinating on.

        Genealogies of the Movement

      <div class="question">
        Over the last twenty years, the community accountability movement has experimented with interventions against violence, and primarily gendered and sexual violence, in activist groups, community organizations, neighborhoods, and families. Activists have recovered and revalued <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 72)">“kitchen table” stories</span> by digging into their <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 73)">communities’ histories of responding to violence</span> in times and places where there was no state or the state was not to be trusted. Much of this work has been improvised in self-organized spaces under the radar of formal political organizations, and far too little has been documented or written down. Though it's impossible to tell a single story about the movement, there are <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 74)">several roots</span> out of which CA-TJ practices emerged: the prison abolition movement, critiques of the anti-violence movement, restorative justice practices, and discourses about transformation.

        From Prison Abolition to Community Accountability
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        One key strand of the community accountability & transformative justice genealogy is the prison abolition movement. In the late 1990s, after decades of drastic increases in incarceration, particularly of Black and Latinx people, activists turned from prison reform to more visionary approaches. Drawing on the legacy of abolitionists who fought to end slavery, groups like <a href="http://criticalresistance.org/">Critical Resistance</a> called for an abolition of prisons. By <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 75)">humanizing incarcerated persons</span> and refusing to see them as disposable, abolitionists argued that <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 76)">people who cause harm need more networks of support</span> rather than being torn away from their communities. Their analysis of the <a href="http://criticalresistance.org/about/not-so-common-language/">prison industrial complex</a> explained how prisons and carceral logics had infiltrated our institutions and everyday lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        Together with INCITE!, a national network of feminists of color, they published a statement calling on movements against policing and prison to wide their focus from state violence to interpersonal violence. Harm isn't only coming from the State but is also circulating within communities, particularly in the form of sexualized and gender violence. Thus, abolitionist visions need to develop alternatives to prison that pay particular attention to the safety of women, queer, trans, and gender non-conforming folks.
        <br>
        <br>
        Community accountability organizers began experimenting with alternatives to prison and policing for interpersonal harm, and sexual and partner violence in particular. As rape is often framed as the <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 78)">most extreme test for abolition</span>, INCITE! took on the question of how to address it directly.

        From Non-Profits to Community Organizing
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Critiques from within the anti-violence movement were another major strand that contributed to community accountability-transformative justice visions. Since the 1970s, the women’s movement has increasingly been institutionalized within what INCITE! has called a <a href="http://www.incite-national.org/page/beyond-non-profit-industrial-complex">non-profit industrial complex</a>, where <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 79)">funding</span> from both private and State sources has influenced organizations’ political agendas. Particularly women of color and other marginalized folks have criticized non-profits for <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 81)">channeling energy for radical social change into social services</span>. Such services for survivors of sexual or partner violence can often only offer <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 82)">limited, individualized, and carceral options</span> like therapy or restraining orders. While these options were <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 83)">unsatisfying even to some of the privilege women who could access them, for many marginalized women they were irrelevant</span>, leading to negative outcomes for themselves or others in their communities, like arrest, deportation, commitment to psychiatric facilities, or increased surveillance in their neighborhood.
        <br>
        <br>
        This tendency to <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 84)">turn to the State as a solution</span> to sexual and gender-based violence, for example by advocating for tougher punishments and more prosecution, has been labeled <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/10/against-carceral-feminism/">carceral feminism</a> to emphasize how whitestream approaches that appear progressive nevertheless often contribute to a more carceral society. Activists working with a community accountability lens emphasized, in contrast, how the State upholds systems of oppression that enable interpersonal violence; therefore, it cannot be the solution. Whereas INCITE! pushed abolitionists to consider interpersonal violence and not just state violence (link to section 1 “From Prison Abolition to Community Accountability”), here it did the reverse: it demanded that the anti-violence movement look beyond its focus on interpersonal violence to perceive its participation in State violence.
        <br>
        <br>
        Rejecting the idea that the State or the non-profit be the primary actor responsible for dealing with violence, many activists focused on the community instead. Activists drew on <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 85)">community organizing models</span> to develop <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 86)">strategies to mobilize communities</span> to address sexual violence. They emphasized a <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 87)">relational, interconnected vision of justice</span>, rather than one of separation, in which the <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 77)">community embodied those relationships that needed repair</span> after violence.

    <div class="question-content accardion" id="restorative">
      <div class="title title-font unitalic">
        From Restorative to Transformative Justice
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Abolitionists and anti-violence activists sought alternatives to carceral ways of dealing with violence in the justice practices of indigenous communities in North America and Australasia, as well as African philosophies of ubuntu that emphasize interconnection as the basis for justice practices.  These have been popularized in non-indigenous communities as restorative justice. Through methods of mediation and community circles, everyone closely connected to a harm is seen as a stakeholder who participates together in repairing harm and formulating solutions.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, abolitionist and anti-violence activists found themselves critical of some restorative justice principles. They seemed unsuited for the <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 88)">asymmetries of power</span> between abusers and survivors and the potential <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 89)">retraumatization of a meeting between a survivor and perpetrator</span>. Restorative justice also lacked an analysis of <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 90)">systems of oppression</span> and of <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 91)">the State</span>. Whereas the term ‘restorative’ suggests that a community needs to find harmony after it is disrupted by violence, these activists used the term transformative justice to show that <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 92)">that status quo is one of ongoing violence and oppression that must itself be transformed</span>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The word transformation suggests looking at big picture system change rather than just 'cleaning up' after harm. Such deep metamorphosis requires more than just a change of mind, <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 93)">but new embodied practices on emotional, spiritual, and physical levels</span>. Community accountability & transformative justice activists found resources for talking about transformation in various, sometimes unexpected places: <span class="rollover" (click)="openRollover(rollover, 94)">Black men’s work in ‘batterer intervention’</span>, spiritual traditions, and somatics and body-work practices.
