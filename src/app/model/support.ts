The group recognized that it wasn\'t just an individual problem, but a community problem, and that the community as a whole could take action on it. As the survivor says, "Until we were all in the room, I kept thinking it was just my problem and I wasn\'t sure what steps to take to make sure other people would be safe. This circle was empowering for all of us, but especially for me, in large part because we took action together."
