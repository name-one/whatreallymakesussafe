INCITE! in particular put out some amazing thought pieces on [community accountability] and really sparked these conversations in all these different places. <strong>Everyone\'s trying to come up with it on their own</strong>. I know that\'s how we felt a few years back in Chicago. We were like, <strong>we\'re going to ground this in what INCITE! has written</strong>. We\'re going to connect with INCITE! when we can.',

        quote: 'By the time I left Women and Girls CAN, I felt like we had come up with a lot of <strong>theories that were right on, and the implementation of them is so challenging</strong>. I feel like there are very few examples right now [in 2013] of where they\'ve been implemented in a <strong>sustainable way</strong>. It\'s easy to come up with examples â€“ like our healing circle. Or another example, here was an act of violence and the community came together, because the right people were at the table and somebody was trained in restorative justice, and they came up with a process and it was good.'
        + '<\/br><\/br>' + 'But that\'s really different than saying: <strong>Let\'s take a community in Chicago</strong>, a whole neighborhood in Chicago. And let\'s <strong>remove the PIC</strong> [prison industrial complex] and <strong>remove the traditional ways of going to social service agencies and traditional shelters</strong> which are so problematic most of the time. Let\'s take all that out and what infrastructure do we put in its place that can really respond to violence. I haven\'t seen that yet. I think Mimi Kim in California did some interesting work, we were looking at that very closely. Not even going neighborhood-wide, just a ten block radius, <strong>how do you set something up that really kept people safe and responded to acts of violence and prevented acts of violence and didn\'t rely on any of the traditional structures?</strong>',
