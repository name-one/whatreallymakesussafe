      question: 'In general, ‘community accountability’ and ‘transformative justice’ describe community-based, self-organized responses to violence, particularly sexual violence and intimate partner violence, that support survivor and community safety, prevent future violence, and hold perpetrators and communities accountable for their behaviors and the conditions which allowed violence to occur.'
      + 'Community accountability was first coined and developed by INCITE!, national network of feminist of color, and particularly by their member group CARA (Communities Against Rape and Abuse) from Seattle. '
      + 'The term “transformative justice” has been developed in particular by GenerationFIVE in their work to end child sexual abuse in 5 generations. '
      + 'These terms describe visionary, new approaches to harm which are applied to many different kinds of work. My interviewees (button here to ‘Meet the Folks Doing the Work’ section) described work that ranged from reading groups to years-long accountability processes with perpetrators, from neighborhood organizing with local businesses for queer and trans safety to mediation processes between persons causing and persons experiencing harm. They told stories about what brought them into this work and the learning processes they\'ve been through in their organizations or communities, including challenges they\'ve faced and questions they are still marinating on.',

      question: 'Over the last twenty years, the community accountability movement has been experimenting with interventions against violence, and primarily gendered and sexual violence, in activist groups, community organizations, neighborhoods, and families. People have recovered and revalued “kitchen table” stories (1) by digging into their communities’ histories of responding to violence (3) in times and places where there was no state or the state was not to be trusted. Much of this work has been improvised in self-organized spaces under the radar of formal political organizations, and far too little has been documented or written down. Though it\'s impossible to tell a single story about the movement, there are several roots (2) that can be traced out of which CA-TJ practices emerged: the prison abolition movement, critiques from within the anti-violence movement, and restorative justice practices and discourses on transformation.',

      title: 'From Prison Abolition to Community Accountability',
      question: 'One key strand of the community accountability & transformative justice genealogy is the prison abolition movement. In the late 1990s, after decades of drastic increase in incarceration, particularly of Black and Latinx people, activists turned from prison reform to more visionary approaches like abolishing prisons altogether. The national network Critical Resistance was formed and began thinking broadly about the way prisons had infiltrated our lives by talking about the prison-industrial-complex. By humanizing incarcerated persons and refusing to see them as disposable (1), this work helped rebuild relationships with persons who had been torn away from their communities (2).'
      + '<\/br><\/br>' + 'INCITE!, a national network of feminists of color formed several years later, published a statement together with Critical Resistance, explaining that prison abolitionist discourses needed to pay more attention to gender and the ways the prison industrial complex impacts trans and gender non-conforming folks and women.  '
      + '<\/br><\/br>' + 'It also suggested that prison abolition was focusing on state violence while overlooking interpersonal violence. Harm isn\'t only coming from the State but is also circulating within communities, particularly in the form of sexualized and gender violence. Thus, abolitionist visions need to develop alternatives to prison that pay particular attention to the safety of women, queer, trans, and gender non-conforming folks.'
      + '<\/br><\/br>' + 'Community accountability stepped in as a series of experiments to develop approaches to harm. These focused not on punishment or individualization, but on collective and individual accountability and change (3).  Rape is often framed as the most extreme test for abolition (4), and INCITE! took on the question of how to address it outside of prisons and policing directly.',

A lot of us are coming from this abolitionist standpoint of “We don’t want prisons to exist anymore and how do we concretely do that?” One way to do that is to get people out of prison and help them stay out of prison.',

So, and that’s part of the reason, as compromised and compromising as it is to go in and out of the prison to teach a class, I think creating those connections across the prison walls is really important, that movement across the walls and creating those connections.'

Community accountability is working against that, to try to question that atomization.'

The genocide of trying to destroy those forms of life, we have to address that. We have to acknowledge that prison is about destroying those relationships, those specific forms of life that have developed in this white settler state – the white supremacy of heteropatriarchy and all that.

      question: 'Critiques from within the anti-violence movement were another major strand in creating community accountability-transformative justice visions. Since the 1970s, the women’s movement has increasingly been institutionalized within what INCITE! has called a non-profit industrial complex, where funding from both private and State sources has influenced those organizations’ political agendas (6 & 9).Particularly women of color and other marginalized folks criticized how non-profits functioned to channel energy for radical social change into social services (1). Non-profit services for survivors of sexual or partner violence could often only offer limited, individualized, and carceral options (4). These were options which some survivors didn\’t want but many survivors, particularly marginalized ones, couldn\'t actually access because it would have negative outcomes for themselves or others in their communities (3) like arrest, deportation, involuntary commitment to psychiatric facilities, or increased policing and surveillance in their neighborhood.'
      + '<\/br><\/br>' + 'This tendency to turn to the State as a solution to sexual and gender-based violence (2), for example through more prosecutions or restraining orders, has been labeled carceral feminism because of its contribution to a carceral society. Activists working with a community accountability lens, on the other hand, emphasized how the State upholds systems of oppression that enable interpersonal violence; therefore, it cannot be the solution to such interpersonal violence. Whereas INCITE! pushed abolitionists to consider interpersonal violence and not just state violence (jump to section 1 “From Prison Abolition to Community Accountability”), here it did the reverse: it demanded that the anti-violence movement look beyond its focus on interpersonal violence to perceive its participation in state violence.'
      + '<\/br><\/br>' + 'Rejecting the idea that the State or the non-profit be the primary actor responsible for dealing with violence, many activists focused on the community instead. But what is a community? ‘Community’ might mean a shared identity, shared values, or shared geography. Activists drew on community organizing models (7 & 8) for strategies to mobilize communities to address sexual violence. They emphasized a relational, interconnected vision of justice, rather than one of separation (5).',

          quote: 'The challenges that emerged for the anti-violence movement because of the broader political changes became key sources of tension between distinct groups of anti-violence activists during this era.  One group remained committed to a broader analysis of the systemic causes of violence against women, arguing as strongly as ever for the need for radical social change work based on an understanding of the role that systems advocacy and coalition politics could play in that.  For this group, the problem of persistent gender inequality, as a structural problem, remained at the center of the analytical paradigm that activists remained committed to.  Another group coalesced around a different formation.  Compelled to respond to conservative state tendencies regarding families, gender, and sexuality, they pursued a safer, less antagonistic strategy that they expected would be more acceptable to the new conservative national, legislative, and local leadership.  This group distanced itself from the former activist-oriented agenda aimed at social change and developed a more professional identity as ‘specialists’ who worked with women who experienced male violence.  Believing that politically they would be better positioned to compete for public support, the feminist activists in this latter group became counselors, community organizers became project administrators, and advocates became apologists for the system.'
          + '<\/br><\/br>' + 'Evidence of the tensions between these two approaches in the anti-violence movement echoed broader feminist debates at the time about social change versus social work and the ideological positions that framed each approach.  Radical, anti-racist feminists argued that power was at the heart of male violence against women and that only through liberation of women would the problem of male violence end.  Liberal feminists took a more moderate approach, arguing for expanding political and civil rights rather than creating structural change.  This strategic and analytical divergence became one of the first obvious sources of tension between women of color and radical grassroots activists, and the more affluent mainstream white women who occupied leadership positions at the time [the early 1990s].”'

      question: 'Abolitionists and anti-violence activists sought alternatives to carceral ways of dealing with violence in the justice practices of indigenous communities in North America and Australasia, as well as African philosophies of ubuntu, which emphasize interconnection as the basis for justice practices.  These have been popularized in non-indigenous communities as restorative justice. Through methods of mediation and community circles, everyone closely connected to a harm is seen as a stakeholder who participates together in formulating a solution to the problem.'

They seemed unsuited for the asymmetries of power between abusers and survivors (5) and the potential retraumatization a meeting between a survivor and perpetrator could cause (1). Restorative justice also lacked an analysis of systems of oppression and of the State (2 & 3). Whereas restorative justice suggests that a community\'s \'peace\' should be restored after being disrupted by violence, these activists used the term transformative justice to show that no original state of \'peace\' ever existed, but one of ongoing violence and oppression that must be transformed (4).'

Such deep metamorphosis requires more than just a change of mind, but new embodied practices on emotional, spiritual, and physical levels (6).

Yet in cases of sexual and domestic violence, the community often sides with the perpetrator rather than the victim. As Deer (2009:156) argues, in many Native American communities, these models are often pushed on domestic violence survivors to pressure them to reconcile with their families and “restore” the community without sufficient concern for their personal safety. In addition, Native American domestic violence advocates have been critical that some restorative justice processes co-opt “traditional” forms of governance to address domestic violence. They argue that Native communities have been pressured to adopt “circle sentencing” because it is a traditional indigenous practice. Some advocates contend that no such traditional practice exists in their communities.

Restorative justice approaches seek to increase the involvement of community stakeholders, more fully address survivor’s rights in the judicial process, and identify means to repair harm and restore balance in the community.

Other Restorative Justice models are offered as post-incarceration rehabilitation programs intended to “restore” the community standing of the person or people that are abusive.

They weren\'t in the lives of the people that they had hurt. They had hurt multiple people and one of them gave them a list of “You need to be accountable, here\'s your stuff, and I never want to see you again.” It hit them pretty heavy and they were looking to identify with other people who caused harm. To talk about what does accountability look like, to find resources and readings. But almost all of them are organizer to organizer, how do we hold people accountable, survivor stories, which I think are really important and hold a different place, but none of them were like, “Hey, I\'ve had a really hard time trying to be accountable, this is what I\'ve tried to do, this is where I felt defensive and angry.” '

But I think its easy to distance ourselves, like we\'ve never fucked up, our shit doesn\'t stink, you know, and it\'s just weird that there\'s a big gap. Because we know that there are lots of people who\'ve successfully been accountable to something, right? That could be being accountable to keeping the kitchen clean for my roommates. [Work with perpetrators] is what folks want to focus on so hard, and then there are actually gaps in hearing from people who\'ve actually been through accountability processes on how that was for them.'

I feel like there are very few examples right now of where they\'ve been implemented in a sustainable way.  It\'s easy to come up with examples – like our healing circle. Or another example, here was an act of violence and the community came together, because the right people were at the table and somebody was trained in restorative justice, and they came up with a process and it was good.'

And let\'s remove the PIC and remove the traditional ways of going to social service agencies and traditional shelters which are so problematic most of the time.  Let\'s take all that out and what infrastructure do we put in its place that can really respond to violence.  I haven\'t seen that yet.  I think Mimi Kim in California did some interesting work, we were looking at that very closely.  Not even going neighborhood-wide, just a ten block radius, how do you set something up that really kept people safe and responded to acts of violence and prevented acts of violence and didn\'t rely on any of the traditional structures?',

But if prisons are going to be abolished, if we are going to live in a world without rape and without sexual assault, and I think we can, then we have to scale it up or we have to articulate it in ways that more people can interact with and understand and buy into.',
