There had to be some common ground for mediation, but both were too emotionally invested to find it themselves, so they asked for mediation.  I currently offer a <strong>mediation support service</strong> in a social centre in London, but I find that people would rather turn to friends that they can trust, rather than someone they have never met before!

        + '<br><br>' +'But the <strong>next step is figuring out what the survivor wants to happen, what the perpetrator would like to change or act on in light of the circumstances... and every situation is different. A common resolution is that there is social separation of the two parties, where they arrange to not be at the same events at the same time. Or maybe the perpetrator will be excluded from activities for a period of time. Usually the community supports this by organising around that, (eg. if both are facilitating at a workshop event, etc), but sometimes it\'s a difficult matter of confidentiality, where a community may be neeed to support the outcomes of a survivor\'s requests, but it is part of the request that people don\'t speak of the event, or of the specific details of the incident.'
        + '<br><br>' +'Then, thirdly, there are the <strong>processes of realising those defined terms</strong>. As usual, <strong>things in practice don\'t pan out as well as they do in theory</strong>, and conflict usually arises out of that, especially when people are missing out on things, eg. events, that they resent missing out on, or resent sacrifices in general that they hadn\'t thought of in beginning the mediation process. So <strong>continual mediation</strong> is necessary to iron out those things. Some things don\'t get resolved, and some requests get ignored, so there are a lot of tense and angry emotions surrounding this process. Another issue is the <strong>reaction or behaviour of the community</strong> surrounding said people. Lots of people will have formed a judgment about a situation, and it is tiring and sometimes futile to remind people not to make decisions about circumstances that they aren\'t knowlegeable about!

Because I walked into this process and I wasn\'t close friends with anyone involved. At first, I was like, "Oh this is weird."

Some people brought [that] up in the meeting, they were like [...] "<strong>We feel like certain ways that you all have dealt with this process is punitive</strong>.

          + '<br><br>' +'I\'ve seen people not be accountable because they\'re like, "Well I have my trauma story, so I can\'t do anything wrong." And people are like, "Actually, yeah, you are doing some things wrong." I don\'t invalidate your trauma story, but you need to change your behavior.',

        quote: 'Of course, there are always lots of hurdles, and no matter how you word or approach some things, <strong>some people will refuse to accept what is being expressed</strong>. It\'s really tough, and can be very frustrating. As I said before, it\'s usually very difficult to communicate with someone that what they have done has upset someone else, especially if they associate themselves with feminism or fights against general, theorised oppression. What occurs very often is that <strong>people involved with a lot of activism find it very difficult to admit to their own destructive or insensitive (or violent or abusive) behaviour</strong>. So that is the initial challenge, and I am still trying to find a nice way to say "This person feels that you\'re a perpetrator." No matter how it\'s communicated, there is usually a pretty aggressive reaction.'
        + '<br><br>' +'So, with them, while this is happening, <strong>I try to explain it in other terms, in analogies that they can relate to.</strong> If I know something about their lives, I equate it to a situation where they may feel like a victim, like if they are riding a bike, and a car driver cuts them off... I know this sounds trivial and simplistic, but sometimes it has to be an <strong>external example that doesn\'t threaten people, which then you bring back to a real situation of violence, where the stakes are higher, and then people start to understand the feeling of having less power in a dynamic</strong>. Obviously perpetrators usually have more power, and they are unaware of it, or reluctant to admit it. So those are initial steps. Of course, people usually believe they are acting to the best of their knowledge and ability, and to explain to them that there was an oppressive or abusive result regardless of this, can be really difficult. Sometimes, people immediately recognise the situation and are really sorry, which cuts out that step.'
        + '<br><br>' +'What is good to remember that even in a violent incient, one of intended or accidental assault, there is always a <strong>set of conditions that determined that behaviour</strong>, whether we understadn them or not. And <strong>working through these conditions is the only way to help avoid another similar occurrence</strong>. If there is patience an understanding, then people can really work through their shit if they want to.',

        quote: 'We might start from questions like: <strong>What does accountability mean? What does accountability look like? How does accountability feel?</strong> This is not to say that accountability can be anything - we push folks to think about their actions and impact, the amends they owe, and the changes they need to make. We ask people to consider <strong>what they need for their safety and healing</strong>, and what it would take for lasting transformation to take place. We ask them <strong>what might get in the way of accountability</strong> - what experiences or memories they might need to revisit, what beliefs or messaging they might need to unlearn. But it is to acknowlege that accountability means different things to different people, and those specificities shoul shape the process and its goals.'
          + '<br><br>' +'For example: I have heard <strong>survivors of violence</strong> express that accountability would mean having their experiences valiated; feeling a shift in their community spaces; having a coherent narrative of what happened to them. <strong>Sometimes, it is important for these things to work in relation to the person who did the violence; other times, it\'s not. Sometimes it is, but that isn\'t possible</strong> - or at least not in the way they envision, right now. But sometimes there are other ways to get a piece of what they need. Having supported or facilitated conversations with loved ones might feel validating. Having a meeting at their work, school, or organizing space might start to shift dynamics that allowed violence to take place. Exchanging letters or other mediate communication with the person who did violence might allow a survivor to articulate their experience in a helpful way. These are actions all of us are capable of supporting right now. I have heard <strong>people who bore witness to violence</strong> describe accountability as expressing support for survivors; holding clear and consistent boundaries amongst themselves; learning the skills they need to better intervene. An organization might show their support for survivors through a collective statement, or simply through daily actions of interdependent care. A family might learn to express and respect boundaries by practicing open communication and consent. A group of friends might prepare themselves to prevent and stop violence by taking a course in mediation, de-escalation, or medical care. These, too, are things that many of us can do.'
          + '<br><br>' +'<strong>This doesn\'t mean that everyone is always satisfied</strong> - sometimes folks don\'t get what they want - or what they want changes - and it can be painful and unfair.

I was working with someone who moved out of the state, and they were like, "Can I give whoever I\'m interviewing for a house your number so they could call you if they have any questions about the accountability process?" I said okay. When people would call, that\'s what they would ask. They\'d be like, "So, they\'re cool now right?" And I\'m like "What oes that mean?" (laughs).'

          + '<br><br>' +'One thing that\'s come up in my work as a facilitator, people would come to me and be like, "So you need to give this person the go ahead. Can they be in this space? Are they being accountable?" Really that\'s a false set-up. <strong>I\'m not the cops</strong>. I\'m not here to tell you such-and-such did their time and they get the gold star and they\'re \'safe\' to be back in community. Shannon Perez-Darby from the [Northwest] Network talks a lot about <strong>accountability as a skill</strong>. It\'s not like you\'re as if "Okay, I am accountable to what I did and now it\'s behind me and now I\'m done," but accountability is a skill that you use everyday.'
          + '<br><br>' +'I\'m not the cops, I\'m not here to tell you such-and-such did their time and they get the gold star and they\'re \'safe\' to be back in community. I want to <strong>move away from this assumption that some people are safe because of their actions</strong> and other people are not safe because of their actions. I want us to move towars looking at how are we all capable of causing harm, and asking: <strong>how do we form a community where we can still prevent harm from happening even though each one of us has the capacity to do harm?</strong> It is not like folks are necessarily just bad people until they\'re accountable and unsafe until they\'re accountable. I want to move away from this, because it is the very framework or logic of the prison system, that some people are criminals until they do x, y, and z or pay their time.'

And I don\'t want them to be necessarily demonized for the rest of their life as someone who\'s fucked up, you know?

We see ourselves coming in at this point where things have fallen apart, and then <strong>our work is building things back to where moving forward is possible again</strong>. Where there are relationships where trust is present or where there are supportive situations and where people\'s lives are in a place where they can do this work on their own, that\'s when we see it as time to step back. So yeah, I think that\'s our way of saying that obviously <strong>there isn\'t an endpoint to a process or an endpoint of transformation</strong> but I think it can get to a place where <strong>it moves on its own</strong>, or at least that moving it forward is the default rather than this radical, new, outside thing.',
