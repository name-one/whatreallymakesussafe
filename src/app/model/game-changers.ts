        quote: 'In a way it commonly starts, I think, <strong>a situation occurred between two friends of mine</strong>, and being someone who has experienced partner violence, stranger violence - both sexual and non-sexual - <strong>they came to me for support</strong>. I found that, as commonly happens, the survivor had trouble expressing and asserting their opinion/will/intention, and the perpetrator was quite vocal, defensive and aggressive. There had to be some common ground for mediation, but both were too emotionally invested to find it themselves, so they asked for mediation.'
        + '<br><br>' +'I currently offer a <strong>mediation support service</strong> in a social centre in London, but I find that people would rather turn to friends that they can trust, rather than someone they have never met before! Which is totally understandable. Especially if they are specifically seeking support that is non-institutional or non-professional.'
        + '<br><br>' +'I think the main thing is that </strong>trust</strong> is really important. If people don\'t trust me as a mediator, then it\'s not going to work, and it\'s better to find someone that they feel like they can relate to more. <strong>Me being of a certain race, class, gender, sexual preference (non-white, immigrant, working-class, female, mainly hetero), means that some people will relate to me more, and others not</strong>. And that is what decides if they want to to talk to me or trust me. So in the past, people that have come to me either know me personally, or know me by a reference from someone they trust. I am finding that now that I am in a foreign country and city, where people don\'t know me; less people come to me for support - the trust and pre-knowledge just isn\'t there.',

        quote: 'So I still live in the same neighborhood I lived in when I was at the Audre Lorde Project. It took us a really long time to develop the campaign, because I didn\'t know anything about community accountability when I worked there. <strong>I had been organizing low-wage workers, mostly women of color</strong>, and I\'d done that for about five years before ALP. So I had a lot of structural [skills] – this is how you build the base, this is how you build the campaign, this is what it looks like. They [the Audre Lorde Project] were like "Yeah, but without the police." I was like, "But the police would be the natural target [for our organizing against state violence]." It\'s not that I was down with the police, but I was like, "Oh god, how does this happen!?" '
        + '<br><br>' +'So it took us a year and a half, and we started to </strong>organize local businesses and institutions</strong>, and recruit them. We didn\'t have a curriculum, so we had to create a </strong>"How to Be Safe Outside the System"</strong> training. Many of the businesses would assume they didn\’t have safety strategies, they did but weren\’t explicit to them. They were not written down, they were just in their head as \'this is what we did.\' So we wanted to make it more explicit to them. We wanted to </strong>make sure those strategies included queer and trans folks of color</strong>.'
        + '<br><br>' +'I actually left the Audre Lorde Project in 2010, and went on what I would call my \'experimental journey\'. I went to work at the </strong>New York City Anti-Violence Project</strong>, which at the time when I was working there, was very much within systemic responses. I was kind of </strong>putting my little black queer body in the cog</strong>, and seeing what happens. They did work on domestic violence, sexual violence, hate violence, and did direct services and organizing. I was working on organizing there and I was trying to broaden the way that they thought about organizing and responses to violence.'
        + '<br><br>' +'After that, I went to work for </strong>Communities United for Police Reform</strong>, which coordinate a lot of work to address Stop-and-Frisk and other policing abuses here in New York.'

So I just help people think through their community safety approaches and organizational development.'
        + '<br><br>' +'I\'m a member of a group called </strong>Transform NYC</strong>. It\'s a bunch of different folks who work on community accountability and transformative justice, where we really put on </strong>educational events</strong>. […] For all of us who like to learn before we do, or so we have the option to learn and do, we thought we\'d do that. So we\'ve been partnering with Mimi Kim from Creative Interventions. We had Mimi come in and she would do these awesome one hour or two hour presi\'s, and then we would discuss.'
        + '<br><br>' +'We also did this broader community event where we watched this film, "Attack the Block," about aliens coming to the hood and the community has to defend itself from them. We had a whole panel and discussion afterwards about what\'s applicable from the movie and what is not, what do we see in community-based approaches to violence.

        + '<br><br>' +'I think we got our original model from <strong>Philly\’s Pissed and Philly Stands Up<strong>. And they came about after dealing with a couple of sexual assaults that happened at this big show there. But they created two separate collectives: one to deal with survivors, and one to deal with perpetuators and accountability. A lot of our work came from going to workshops that they presented. The <strong>"Support" zine<strong> put together by Cindy Crabb has also informed us a lot, but I feel like that had less to do with perpetuators.'
        + '<br><br>' +'So it was seeing these things around us and seeing <strong>how we could apply it here in New York<strong>. Not really knowing a lot about transformative justice or any of these concepts before it all came together, and being just really happy to find them along the way, like "Oh this is really helpful!" I think now that we\’ve become aware of a larger movement and more of the conceptual drive behind it, it\’s spurred us to try to be more \‘on point,\’ get more materials together, and share our experiences.',

When I was a little kid I testified that this uncle of mine was taking me to the zoo that one day that he wasn\'t, and he owes me now. So if you just get me the name, I will have the guy killed." I was kind of like "Oy yoy yoy. That’s crazy." That got me sort of thinking about, well, obviously <strong>I don’t feel like I am in position to have any human killed, right? No matter how much I am angry at them...<strong> My friend, I think he was trying to be compassionate in his own way. He comes from a very different, very violent place and that\’s just how it makes sense.

He was high on crack one night, he held a gun to my face and told me that he was going to kill me, it was the scariest night of my life. We had all these mutual friends, we are kind of part of the same suburban subculture crew, and... I found out that he had been seriously sexually and physically abused by his father as a very young kid. <strong>I was viscerally terrified of him... but I would also be thinking, "This poor guy must be in such deep pain if [this is] the only joy he seems to get out of the world<strong>". Because I had my own issues but I was more or less pretty happy and comfortable and I felt that there was a place for me in the world that I didn\’t need to be constantly reasserting because I wasn\’t forced to do that.'

I just kept on running up against the barriers of what we were able to offer, specifically because my reading of the history of the <strong>movement to end violence against women<strong> in the United States is that it\'s been <strong>co-opted by the criminal legal system<strong>. To do that work in the U.S. now, especially as a 501c3 or as a non-profit, it feels there are all these ways that it\'s increasingly necessary to be involved with the police and with child welfare and all of those things.'
        + '<br><br>' +'In every case that I would work, there would be real <strong>limitations to what we were able to offer<strong>. That became really clear cut, especially along racial lines and class lines, and in different ways in terms of sexual orientation and gender identity. It felt like over and over again, I had to say to people, "Well, you know your options are to report this to the police or to do nothing at all." Maybe you can have individualized counseling for a certain period of time but that\'s really the only intervention that we have. Either we can take it to trial or we can do this one-on-one step with you, but there\'s nothing else that we can do. For so many people who either didn\'t want to or weren\'t able to report a case to the police, they were like, "What do you mean, that\'s all you can do? You\'re a sexual violence organization, why can you not offer anything else?"'
        + '<br><br>' +'On the one hand, only the <strong>people with the most privilege were able to access our services<strong> and use them well. At the same time, even those people, even the \‘wealthy white straight whatever\’ people, who felt fine about that system, even they weren\'t actually getting what they needed. So even the women for whom everything went as it was supposed to and they talked to the police and went to the hospital and they were able to get a trial and they had a court date, <strong>even those women were not saying that they felt healing or justice or restoration or power<strong> or anything that our rhetoric was telling them that they would get in that process. So feeling that over and over again had me looking for another way of doing things.'
        + '<br><br>' +'I think that <strong>most people\'s vision of justice was more relational and interconnected<strong> than we thought it would be. We were trained to not recognize that or to see it as wrong. So I would hear from people, "This person assaulted me, but he\'s my husband and I love him and I don\'t want him to go to jail." Or, "My dad abused me, but it\'s complicated, like I still care about him." And the way that I was trained to respond to those feelings was "You\'re delusional," "He hurt you, he\'s in the wrong, the appropriate feeling for you to have is anger and to want revenge and retribution and whatever." I think in later years of working there, I remember hearing that so much and just being so trained to shut it down, that that\'s something that sticks with me around people\'s visions of justice, that they are actually so different from the kinds of justice that we\'re trained to shovel them into.',
