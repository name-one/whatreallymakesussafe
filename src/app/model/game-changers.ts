They also hold a range of other roles as community organizers, consultants, academics, and writers. Project participants identified with various communities, particularly queer communities and communities of color, though the project also included a fair number of white anti-racist allies. Most interviewees are from the U.S., with the East and West Coast strongly represented, and two who have worked in Canada, England, and Australia. Most interviews were carried out by Melanie, and several were conducted by comrades from the Transformative Justice Kollektiv Berlin.`,

I found that, as commonly happens, the survivor had trouble expressing and asserting their opinion/will/intention, and the perpetrator was quite vocal, defensive and aggressive. There had to be some common ground for mediation, but both were too emotionally invested to find it themselves, so they asked for mediation.'
        + '<br><br>' +'I currently offer a <strong>mediation support service</strong> in a social centre in London, but I find that people would rather turn to friends that they can trust, rather than someone they have never met before! Which is totally understandable. Especially if they are specifically seeking support that is non-institutional or non-professional.'
        + '<br><br>' +'I think the main thing is that </strong>trust</strong> is really important. If people don\'t trust me as a mediator, then it\'s not going to work, and it\'s better to find someone that they feel like they can relate to more. <strong>Me being of a certain race, class, gender, sexual preference (non-white, immigrant, working-class, female, mainly hetero), means that some people will relate to me more, and others not</strong>. And that is what decides if they want to to talk to me or trust me. So in the past, people that have come to me either know me personally, or know me by a reference from someone they trust. I am finding that now that I am in a foreign country and city, where people don\'t know me; less people come to me for support - the trust and pre-knowledge just isn\'t there.',

        quote: 'So I still live in the same neighborhood I lived in when I was at the Audre Lorde Project. It took us a really long time to develop the campaign, because I didn\'t know anything about community accountability when I worked there. <strong>I had been organizing low-wage workers, mostly women of color</strong>, and I\'d done that for about five years before ALP. So I had a lot of structural [skills] – this is how you build the base, this is how you build the campaign, this is what it looks like. They [the Audre Lorde Project] were like "Yeah, but without the police." I was like, "But the police would be the natural target [for our organizing against state violence]." It\'s not that I was down with the police, but I was like, "Oh god, how does this happen!?" '
        + '<br><br>' +'So it took us a year and a half, and we started to </strong>organize local businesses and institutions</strong>, and recruit them. We didn\'t have a curriculum, so we had to create a </strong>"How to Be Safe Outside the System"</strong> training. Many of the businesses would assume they didn\’t have safety strategies, they did but weren\’t explicit to them. They were not written down, they were just in their head as \'this is what we did.\' So we wanted to make it more explicit to them. We wanted to </strong>make sure those strategies included queer and trans folks of color</strong>.'
        + '<br><br>' +'I actually left the Audre Lorde Project in 2010, and went on what I would call my \'experimental journey\'. I went to work at the </strong>New York City Anti-Violence Project</strong>, which at the time when I was working there, was very much within systemic responses. I was kind of </strong>putting my little black queer body in the cog</strong>, and seeing what happens. They did work on domestic violence, sexual violence, hate violence, and did direct services and organizing. I was working on organizing there and I was trying to broaden the way that they thought about organizing and responses to violence.'
        + '<br><br>' +'After that, I went to work for </strong>Communities United for Police Reform</strong>, which coordinate a lot of work to address Stop-and-Frisk and other policing abuses here in New York.'

So I just help people think through their community safety approaches and organizational development.'
        + '<br><br>' +'I\'m a member of a group called </strong>Transform NYC</strong>. It\'s a bunch of different folks who work on community accountability and transformative justice, where we really put on </strong>educational events</strong>. […] For all of us who like to learn before we do, or so we have the option to learn and do, we thought we\'d do that. So we\'ve been partnering with Mimi Kim from Creative Interventions. We had Mimi come in and she would do these awesome one hour or two hour presi\'s, and then we would discuss.'
        + '<br><br>' +'We also did this broader community event where we watched this film, "Attack the Block," about aliens coming to the hood and the community has to defend itself from them. We had a whole panel and discussion afterwards about what\'s applicable from the movie and what is not, what do we see in community-based approaches to violence.

        + '<br><br>' +'I think we got our original model from <strong>Philly\’s Pissed and Philly Stands Up<strong>. And they came about after dealing with a couple of sexual assaults that happened at this big show there. But they created two separate collectives: one to deal with survivors, and one to deal with perpetuators and accountability. A lot of our work came from going to workshops that they presented. The <strong>"Support" zine<strong> put together by Cindy Crabb has also informed us a lot, but I feel like that had less to do with perpetuators.'
        + '<br><br>' +'So it was seeing these things around us and seeing <strong>how we could apply it here in New York<strong>. Not really knowing a lot about transformative justice or any of these concepts before it all came together, and being just really happy to find them along the way, like "Oh this is really helpful!" I think now that we\’ve become aware of a larger movement and more of the conceptual drive behind it, it\’s spurred us to try to be more \‘on point,\’ get more materials together, and share our experiences.',

When I was a little kid I testified that this uncle of mine was taking me to the zoo that one day that he wasn\'t, and he owes me now. So if you just get me the name, I will have the guy killed." I was kind of like "Oy yoy yoy. That’s crazy." That got me sort of thinking about, well, obviously <strong>I don’t feel like I am in position to have any human killed, right? No matter how much I am angry at them...<strong> My friend, I think he was trying to be compassionate in his own way. He comes from a very different, very violent place and that\’s just how it makes sense.

He was high on crack one night, he held a gun to my face and told me that he was going to kill me, it was the scariest night of my life. We had all these mutual friends, we are kind of part of the same suburban subculture crew, and... I found out that he had been seriously sexually and physically abused by his father as a very young kid. <strong>I was viscerally terrified of him... but I would also be thinking, "This poor guy must be in such deep pain if [this is] the only joy he seems to get out of the world<strong>". Because I had my own issues but I was more or less pretty happy and comfortable and I felt that there was a place for me in the world that I didn\’t need to be constantly reasserting because I wasn\’t forced to do that.'

I just kept on running up against the barriers of what we were able to offer, specifically because my reading of the history of the <strong>movement to end violence against women<strong> in the United States is that it\'s been <strong>co-opted by the criminal legal system<strong>. To do that work in the U.S. now, especially as a 501c3 or as a non-profit, it feels there are all these ways that it\'s increasingly necessary to be involved with the police and with child welfare and all of those things.'
        + '<br><br>' +'In every case that I would work, there would be real <strong>limitations to what we were able to offer<strong>. That became really clear cut, especially along racial lines and class lines, and in different ways in terms of sexual orientation and gender identity. It felt like over and over again, I had to say to people, "Well, you know your options are to report this to the police or to do nothing at all." Maybe you can have individualized counseling for a certain period of time but that\'s really the only intervention that we have. Either we can take it to trial or we can do this one-on-one step with you, but there\'s nothing else that we can do. For so many people who either didn\'t want to or weren\'t able to report a case to the police, they were like, "What do you mean, that\'s all you can do? You\'re a sexual violence organization, why can you not offer anything else?"'
        + '<br><br>' +'On the one hand, only the <strong>people with the most privilege were able to access our services<strong> and use them well. At the same time, even those people, even the \‘wealthy white straight whatever\’ people, who felt fine about that system, even they weren\'t actually getting what they needed. So even the women for whom everything went as it was supposed to and they talked to the police and went to the hospital and they were able to get a trial and they had a court date, <strong>even those women were not saying that they felt healing or justice or restoration or power<strong> or anything that our rhetoric was telling them that they would get in that process. So feeling that over and over again had me looking for another way of doing things.'
        + '<br><br>' +'I think that <strong>most people\'s vision of justice was more relational and interconnected<strong> than we thought it would be. We were trained to not recognize that or to see it as wrong. So I would hear from people, "This person assaulted me, but he\'s my husband and I love him and I don\'t want him to go to jail." Or, "My dad abused me, but it\'s complicated, like I still care about him." And the way that I was trained to respond to those feelings was "You\'re delusional," "He hurt you, he\'s in the wrong, the appropriate feeling for you to have is anger and to want revenge and retribution and whatever." I think in later years of working there, I remember hearing that so much and just being so trained to shut it down, that that\'s something that sticks with me around people\'s visions of justice, that they are actually so different from the kinds of justice that we\'re trained to shovel them into.',

That\'s just not what they say. They say we need more trash cans or tree-trimming or \"get those gang bangers off the street\" or whatever. These issues aren\'t coming up, so I had questions like – <strong>what would it take for those issues to surface?<strong>  What could organizing groups do differently to start responding to issues that really matter for women and girls, and what could the women\'s movement do differently?'

A lot of it was <strong>looking back at old pieces from the 70s, before things in the U.S. got so state-owned<strong>. Before violence against women got silo\'ed into the anti-rape work and the domestic violence work, and all of it funded by the state. You know, there were other ideas of how to approach all of this, and they just kind of got cast aside.

You know, me and my partner that I was with when we started, we dated for five years, we broke up and it was devastating to me. I talked about it at the Support New York meetings, other people changed genders, went through these huge personal transitions, it was brutally intense and beautiful and just regular life stuff was going on that maybe people need communities to support them during. Whatever our sick fucking society, capitalist debt culture tries to, maybe not actively, maybe more insidiously, alienate people from one another and inhibit these kinds of bonds. <strong>So I genuinely don\'t know if I would still be alive if it wasn\'t for the kind of grounding and mental stuff that I had from Support New York<strong>. And being a local guy and having family nearby all the time doesn\'t hurt. And family, that\'s good people, but my community of friends was really important to keeping my mental health in check.'

Some of them are dead, some of them are like the bad kind of lawyer, all kinds of stuff happens. And so, at some point, we stopped meeting all the time, and we stopped checking in as intensely as we used to, then we stop checking in at all, like we only meet once in three months. We\'ve been doing perpetrator accountability process for 7 years. That\'s fucking crazy, that\'s nuts. Of course we stopped prioritizing checking in at some point, and we have to reexamine and reaffirm that it is something important to us because that\'s just the nature of anything. <strong>You have to always recommit<strong>, I think. You don\'t just say, \'I do this thing and I am gonna do this thing and then never interrogate it and never reexamine it ever again.\' You have to constantly be reexamining, reaffirming, recommitting, reestablishing boundaries, you know what I mean.',

At this point, I really feel like <strong>these are my people<strong>, you know, you feel like almost family with these folks, and I would have their backs and I know that they have mine. And I know that we\'re able to talk about whatever comes up and support each other in all these different ways. I think that when those relationships started feeling solid and falling into place is when doing TJ work actually started to feel possible for me. But I think that <strong>we\'ve always seen relationship-building as not being the precursor to the work but actually being the work itself<strong>.

But our agenda didn\'t include doing media justice work or healing organizing or community accountability even. It started with: <strong>"What would it look like if a different group of people other than the people who have traditionally run the women\'s movement got to define what the issue was, how they would want to respond to it, and got to take action and be the leaders?"<strong> Instead of having the ED of the local organization be the leader. We weren\'t even sure it would be around violence against women at first. It was like, what if a group of younger women got to just define the issues for themselves. Maybe we do reproductive justice work, maybe it\'s economic justice work, maybe it\'s something none of us have thought about. It was supposed to be a one year exploratory project.'
        + '<br><br>' +'What happened was when I met with adult women about it, like professors and members of different organizations, they were like "This is a good one year exploratory project. I would like to put out a report." And when I started meeting with <strong>youth<strong>, they were like "<strong>Let\'s just take action together. Why are we studying?"<strong>'
        + '<br><br>' +'It became a 501c3, so we were also part of the non-profit industrial complex. It had several different elements. There was a youth organizing piece called <strong>Females United for Action [FUFA]<strong>, organizing mostly high school students, some college students. FUFA in its early days took the stance that the <strong>reason there\'s so much violence against young women of color was media images of young women of color<strong>. So they did <strong>media justice work<strong>, which was really cool and powerful to watch. Then they became more interested in <strong>healing organizing<strong> and developing concepts around healing. And FUFA started out as a coalition of organizations, and then added individuals, and kind of changed back and forth: there were organizational members of youth groups and also individual young people.'
        + '<br><br>' +'FUFA also went through a lot of work around <strong>trans issues<strong>. FUFA at one point got approached by trans young women asking if they could join and then did a series of sessions on learning about trans oppression and shifted its focus. And actually in the last days of Women and Girls CAN, there were some discussions before I left about whether to change the name Women and Girls CAN because some people felt it didn\'t express being open to trans women and girls.'
        + '<br><br>' +'The <strong>community accountability group<strong> was a group, 7 or 8 women from all different perspectives, all interested in doing this work, some academic, some organizers, some from a social service perspective, all interested in trying to figure this piece out. So it was something more like a think tank than doing actual actions. We met regularly; it was half white women and half women of color. Very focused on <strong>racial justice<strong>. So if women of color couldn\'t make the meetings, we would cancel them. Trying to reflect on how much the women\'s movement in this country has been dominated by white women and really just shut out the voices of anyone who wasn\'t a middle- or upper-class heterosexual white woman. So we were trying to be really conscious of that. And that group put on a bunch of different workshops for the community and put out this writing piece ["Communities Engaged in Resisting Violence"], that came out of all of that. It was trying to document what was happening in Chicago and promote conversations and see if we could move things further. Those were always the two core projects.',

It\'s really tough, and can be very frustrating. As I said before, it\'s usually very difficult to communicate with someone that what they have done has upset someone else, especially if they associate themselves with feminism or fights against general, theorised oppression. What occurs very often is that <strong>people involved with a lot of activism find it very difficult to admit to their own destructive or insensitive (or violent or abusive) behaviour<strong>. So that is the initial challenge, and I am still trying to find a nice way to say "this person feels that you\'re a perpetrator." <strong>No matter how its communicated, there is usually a pretty aggressive reaction<strong>.',

        + '<br><br>' +'It showed up in the report ["Communities Engaged in Resisting Violence"], there\'s a whole section on creating organizational structures because of that. People know of organizations where the male director harasses all the women in the organization or there\'s a guy who works with you and he\'s had relationships with a series of fourteen-year-olds. There are all these examples that people would know about but not want to talk about for fear of harming organizations, right?'
        + '<br><br>' +'So the question of \'<strong>how do you respond to this in a way that\'s transformative, that has accountability for a perpetrator of physical or sexual violence, but doesn\'t hurt the very good cause the organization stands for?<strong>\' is really hard to figure out.'
        + '<br><br>' +'We tried it through the <strong>healing circle<strong> that was in the report. That was <strong>pretty successful in protecting people but not with accountability<strong>, because the perpetrator just said "I take no responsibility" and that was that. The circle was not an accountability circle, it was really for the survivor and the community. Then the community together with the survivor came up with a strategy of how to approach the perpetrator. And that\'s when things didn\'t go super well. We offered a time to all meet and do a circle, but he didn\'t want any of that. That\'s okay in that other good things came from it, but it\'s very hard to figure out.',
