    + '<br><br>' + 'Discrimination laws and hate crimes laws encourage us to understand oppression as something that happens when individuals use bias to deny someone a job because of race or sex or some other characteristic, or beat up and kill someone because of such a characteristic. This way of thinking, sometimes called the "<strong>perpetrator perspective</strong>," makes people think about racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and ableism in terms of <strong>individual behaviors and bad intentions rather than wide-scale structural oppression</strong> that often operates without some obvious individual actor aimed at denying an individual person an opportunity. The violence of imprisoning millions of poor people and people of color, for example, can\’t be adequately explained by finding one nasty racist individual, but instead requires looking at a whole web of institutions, policies, and practices that make it <strong>"normal" and "necessary"</strong> to warehouse, displace, discard, and annihilate poor people and people of color. Thinking about violence and oppression as the work of <strong>"a few bad apples"</strong> undermines our ability to analyze our conditions <strong>systematically and intergenerationally</strong>, and to therefore organize for systemic change.'

    quote: 'The challenges that emerged for the anti-violence movement because of the broader political changes became key sources of tension between distinct groups of anti-violence activists during this era. <strong>One group remained committed to a broader analysis of the systemic causes of violence against women</strong>, arguing as strongly as ever for the need for radical social change work based on an understanding of the role that systems advocacy and coalition politics could play in that. For this group, the problem of persistent gender inequality, as a structural problem, remained at the center of the analytical paradigm that activists remained committed to. <strong>Another group coalesced around a different formation</strong>. Compelled to respond to conservative state tendencies regarding families, gender, and sexuality, <strong>they pursued a safer, less antagonistic strategy</strong> that they expected would be more acceptable to the new conservative national, legislative, and local leadership. This group distanced itself from the former activist-oriented agenda aimed at social change and developed a more professional identity as \‘specialists\’ who worked with women who experienced male violence. Believing that politically they would be better positioned to compete for public support, the feminist activists in this latter group became counselors, community organizers became project administrators, and advocates became apologists for the system.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'Evidence of the tensions between these two approaches in the anti-violence movement echoed broader feminist debates at the time about social change versus social work and the ideological positions that framed each approach. <strong>Radical, anti-racist feminists argued that power was at the heart of male violence against women and that only through liberation of women would the problem of male violence end. Liberal feminists took a more moderate approach, arguing for expanding political and civil rights rather than creating structural change</strong>. This strategic and analytical divergence became one of the first obvious sources of tension between women of color and radical grassroots activists, and the more affluent mainstream white women who occupied leadership positions at the time [the early 1990s]."'

A "good victim" is one who readily accesses and cooperates with the criminal legal system in order to prosecute and incarcerate their batterer or rapist. But when a survivor of sexual or domestic violence is only supported when seen as a "victim of crime," survivors who are already criminalized are not recognized as people in need of support and advocacy. <strong>Survivors are criminalized for being Black, undocumented, poor, transgender, queer, disabled, women or girls of color, in the sex industry, or for having a past "criminal record."</strong> Their experience of violence is diminished, distorted, or disappeared, and they are instead simply seen as criminals who should be punished. They face hostility from police, prosecutors and judges, and they are often denied the support "good victims" receive from anti-violence advocates. These "criminal" survivors are then particularly vulnerable when racist pro-criminalization policies (such as mandatory minimums, the war on drugs, "Felons not Families" deportation enforcement, and increased police authority) are waged against our communities because those policies facilitate and reinforce domestic and sexual violence.'

    + '<br><br>' + 'It is <strong>natural, and even healthy, to feel rage</strong> at the aggressor for assaulting another person, especially a person that we care about. However, it is critical that we are grounded in a value of <strong>recognizing the complexity of each person</strong>, including ourselves. Given the needs and values of a particular community, an accountability process for the aggressor can be confrontational, even angry, but it should not be de-humanizing.'
    + '<br><br>' + '<strong>Dehumanization of aggressors contributes to a larger context of oppression</strong> for everyone. For example, alienation and dehumanization of the offending person <strong>increases a community\’s vulnerability to being targeted</strong> for disproportional criminal justice oppression through heightening the "monster-ness" of another community member. This is especially true for marginalized communities (such as people of color, people with disabilities, poor people, and queer people) who are already targeted by the criminal system because of their "<strong>Other-ness</strong>." When one person in our community is identified as a "monster," that identity is often generalized to everyone in the community. This generalization can even be made by other members of the marginalized community because of internalized oppression.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'Also, dehumanizing the aggressor undermines the process of accountability for the whole community. <strong>If we separate ourselves</strong> from the offenders by stigmatizing them then <strong>we fail to see how we contributed</strong> to conditions that allow violence to happen.'

The following narrative of Joshua\’s life focuses on those experiences in which he was <strong>recruited into negative identity conclusions about himself (i.e. that he is "bad," "disgusting," and "dirty")</strong>. These identity conclusions support his sexual abuse of his daughter. By identifying the experiences in Joshua\’s life in which <strong>he learned these negative identity conclusions</strong> about himself, he has been able to recognize that <strong>his identity is not innate, natural, and static but, rather, fluid and changeable</strong>. As a result, Joshua has been able to challenge these identity conclusions and move closer to his preferences for fairness and justice.'

Joshua\’s own childhood abuse did not cause him to sexually abuse others. Most people who are sexually abused do not abuse others. The meaning Joshua made of his having been abused, however, informed his choices to sexually abuse. Through being sexually abused, Joshua was recruited into believing that he was "dirty," "bad," and "disgusting," and, therefore, he acted accordingly. As a result, investigating this meaning he made about himself for having been sexually abused is important to interrupting Joshua\’s perpetration of sexual abuse.'

    quote: '"Surviving" refers to all the things a person does to resist objectification and attempt to take back power in one\’s own life. Some of the things that people do while surviving are noble and beautiful and consistent with the story of how a survivor should act. They make great United Way copy. Many of the things that people do to survive are complicated and feel shameful, scary or confusing to survivors and to outside observers.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'As advocates, we may find ourselves cheering survivors\’ actions that resonate with us and avoiding the ones that trouble us, but all of it matters. All of it is part of the messy process of survival and all of it merits our thoughtful and compassionate attention.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'But, when it comes to being fully open to the entire span of survivors experiences—of the choices and actions survivors take within the context of surviving abuse—the anti-violence movement—from across the spectrum of response—has fallen short. We center people who batter as the "actors" in abusive relationships and we can describe in detail the actions they take to establish abusive systems of power, control and exploitation, but we really speak very little about what survivors do to survive. We are constrained by the need to convince the larger community to support survivors—to prove that survivors are good and therefore worthy of care and regard.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'We are constrained by an ironically sexist applied domestic abuse analysis that centers batterers, people understood to be men, as the only people whose actions "matter". (We are deeply concerned about what <strong>happens to</strong> survivors, but we are less interested in understanding what survivors <strong>do</strong> themselves.)'
    + '<br><br>' + 'We are constrained by our over-reliance on the criminal legal system in our response to domestic violence. And we are constrained by our own pain and discomfort when confronted with the complex realities of survivors\’ (even our own) experiences.'
    + '<br><br>' + '<strong>We</strong> may be reluctant to talk about or help make sense of the complex, confusing choices that survivors make in the context of surviving abuse—but I can assure you that <strong>people who batter are not</strong>. People who batter say: You are just as bad as me. If those people knew what you did, they would never help you. You deserve this. You are the abuser, not me. Our confusion and reluctance colludes with batterers\’ goals.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'Our ambivalence lingers on and, in the meanwhile, our movement to end violence loses credibility with survivors, and community members and institutions—because women act violently AND because survivors use violence to survive.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'We <strong>know</strong> this. We have observed it in the actions of our mothers and ourselves and the women in shelter. And everyone who lives in the world long enough will have the opportunity to observe this for themselves. Women use violence—that is straightforward. The question is: <strong>Who</strong> will assign meaning to this information and <strong>what meaning</strong> will be assigned?'
    + '<br><br>' + 'Since 1997, I have been working in my diverse lesbian, bisexual, trans and gay community in a queer specific anti-violence context. Almost all of the trans and female survivors and most of the male survivors we work with want to avoid the criminal legal system. Since we work in a context of same-sex abuse, we cannot rely on gender to determine if a person is establishing a pattern of abusive power and control, resisting objectification or doing something else altogether. We have developed a very useful assessment process to understand if and how power, control & exploitation may be working in a relationship. We have also had to meet squarely the facts that women batter women and men, men batter women and men, & survivors use violence to resist objectification.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'The <strong>meaning</strong> one man\’s violence against his female partner is formed in the larger context of male violence and male privilege. Even with the absence of "intention" to batter, even when a man is acting out of remedial skills and a lack of emotional competence—those times when a man is just being a asshole but has no intention to turn a subject into an object— his scary actions will more easily be coercive. Like it or not, those actions carry to weight of the history of men\’s coercive control of women. At the same time, when a man has even the slightest will to batter—the conditions of sexism in the world around him will power-boost his attempts at abusive control. With few exceptions, women\’s petulant, mean, scary and violent behaviors against male partners lack a backstory of "women\’s violence" in society— as warriors, or serial rapists, or what have you. Women\’s actions often lack the credibility to leverage institutional supports to establish authority over men. Women can set the stage for coercive control in heterosexual relationships, but it takes a disproportionate degree of determination to do so.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'Still, in many, many conversations, survivors of abuse express feeling trapped in abusive relationships by the guilt and shame and confusion over their own petulant, mean, scary and violent behaviors. Even those behaviors that they used to directly resist abuse. We can all agree that such behaviors matter when they are used to batter someone. But do women\’s petulant, mean, scary and violent behaviors matter even if they do not have the consequence of coercive control? <strong>Or if they are only used to survive abuse?</strong> I say yes.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'We must understand that there is a distinction between "violence" and "abuse". Not all violence is abusive. Some violence is resistant—it is used to resist objectification, to resist abuse.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'These actions are not abuse AND they matter AND their meaning must be understood in context.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'In order to attempt to meet survivors unflinchingly in their full experience, we have to be able to accept survivors as agents--as people who act, not things only acted upon. We must agree that, as people, it matters what survivors do. Even when the choices of survivors are viciously limited, when survivors are between a rock and a hard place, when the toll of threats and crazymaking turn one\’s understanding of the world upside down, what a person does as a survivor matters. It matters because one\’s humanity—one\’s "person-ness"—matters. When advocates are unable to meet survivors in the full, messy, broken, heroic, petty realness of the actual choices that survivors have made—we reinforce the silence and shame that often haunt survivors of violence.'

We ask people to consider <strong>what they need for their safety and healing</strong>, and what it would take for lasting transformation to take place. We ask them <strong>what might get in the way of accountability</strong> – what experiences or memories they might need to revisit, what beliefs or messaging they might need to unlearn.

Sometimes it is, but that isn\’t possible</strong> – or at least not in the way they envision, right now. But sometimes there are other ways to get a piece of what they need. Having supported or facilitated conversations with loved ones might feel validating. Having a meeting at their work, school, or organizing space might start to shift dynamics that allowed violence to take place. Exchanging letters or other mediated communication with the person who did violence might allow a survivor to articulate their experience in a helpful way. These are actions all of us are capable of supporting right now. I have heard <strong>people who bore witness to violence</strong> describe accountability as expressing support for survivors; holding clear and consistent boundaries amongst themselves; learning the skills they need to better intervene. An organization might show their support for survivors through a collective statement, or simply through daily actions of interdependent care. A family might learn to express and respect boundaries by practicing open communication and consent. A group of friends might prepare themselves to prevent and stop violence by taking a course in mediation, de-escalation, or medical care. These, too, are things that many of us can do.'

For this group, the problem of persistent gender inequality, as a structural problem, remained at the center of the analytical paradigm that activists remained committed to. <strong>Another group coalesced around a different formation</strong>. Compelled to respond to conservative state tendencies regarding families, gender, and sexuality, <strong>they pursued a safer, less antagonistic strategy</strong> that they expected would be more acceptable to the new conservative national, legislative, and local leadership. This group distanced itself from the former activist-oriented agenda aimed at social change and developed a more professional identity as \‘specialists\’ who worked with women who experienced male violence.

For this group, the problem of persistent gender inequality, as a structural problem, remained at the center of the analytical paradigm that activists remained committed to. <strong>Another group coalesced around a different formation</strong>. Compelled to respond to conservative state tendencies regarding families, gender, and sexuality, <strong>they pursued a safer, less antagonistic strategy</strong> that they expected would be more acceptable to the new conservative national, legislative, and local leadership. This group distanced itself from the former activist-oriented agenda aimed at social change and developed a more professional identity as \‘specialists\’ who worked with women who experienced male violence. Believing that politically they would be better positioned to compete for public support, the feminist activists in this latter group became counselors, community organizers became project administrators, and advocates became apologists for the system.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'Evidence of the tensions between these two approaches in the anti-violence movement echoed broader feminist debates at the time about social change versus social work and the ideological positions that framed each approach.  <strong>Radical, anti-racist feminists argued that power was at the heart of male violence against women and that only through liberation of women would the problem of male violence end. Liberal feminists took a more moderate approach, arguing for expanding political and civil rights rather than creating structural change</strong>. This strategic and analytical divergence became one of the first obvious sources of tension between women of color and radical grassroots activists, and the more affluent mainstream white women who occupied leadership positions at the time [the early 1990s]."'

This ignores the common lack of rights for children, abuses of power, gender inequality, legacies of slavery and colonization, and other types of violence that pre-date and co-exist with ongoing incidents of violence. As such, these models often focus on the <strong>restoration of the status quo</strong> and ignore the challenge of transforming the conditions of social, economic and political injustice that are the context for, and cause of, violence.'

I mean, it\’s certainly coming from justice, from the TJ framework, but I think more it\’s coming from transformational being used to mean work that\’s not just social services, work that\’s about whole system change in terms of social change.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'It\’s definitely coming from folks who are infusing spirituality through their activism, so the work of folks like the <strong>Movement Strategy Center</strong>[…] They have [the report] "Out of the Spiritual Closet" […] So, you have <strong>Generative Somatics</strong> that has come from Staci Haines and they merged with the <strong>Strozzi Institute</strong>, so they have a particular sort of embodiment approach. And <strong>Forward Stance</strong>, which is really coming from a <strong>Tai Chi tradition and Buddhist tradition</strong>. In terms of leadership development, when we talk about transformational approaches, it\’s a lot about those two approaches.'
    + '<br><br>' + 'Along with folks like <strong>Robert Gass</strong>, who is one of the founders of <strong>Rockwood Institute</strong>, who is increasingly talking about transformation – "The Art of Transformation" is his leadership development training that he leads – and talking about transforming organizations. And what he means by that is, in a sense, <strong>transformation is about the scale of change. That transformation is metamorphosis: when something has transformed, it can\’t go back</strong>. So, that\’s really about the scale of change.'
